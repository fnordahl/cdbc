    # Since we are building the cdbc snap under test locally we need to do
    # some tricks to get it into the snapcraft build environment.
    #
    # Normally you would consume cdbc with the `build-snaps` proprety.
    #
    # You do however need to have a part that creates the empty directory
    # to bind mount the cdbc snap contents to in any case.
